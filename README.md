# Elite-Dangerous-LIFX-Chroma-Integration

This program reacts LIFX and Chroma RGB lighting with Elite Dangerous events.

Credit to Vaypron's chroma-python sdk, making this possible in a simple Python script.

This is still in development, bugs are still present and many features are to be added in the future.

Instructions:

1. Download and install chroma-python from here: https://github.com/chroma-sdk/chroma-python
2. Download file and change directory to that of your ED journal files (usually C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous) and change to your LIFX access token (Use this page to find out how to get your access token: https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/how-to-use-the-following-examples)
3. Run ED
4. Once in the menu start the Python script (will be changed soon for easier use!)
