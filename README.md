# Elite-Dangerous-RGB-Lighting-Integration

# What does it do?

This program reacts LIFX and Chroma RGB lighting with Elite Dangerous events.

Credit to Vaypron's chroma-python sdk, making this possible in a simple Python script.

This is still in development, bugs are still present and many features are to be added in the future.

# How do I set it up?

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.
2. Download and install chroma-python from here: https://github.com/chroma-sdk/chroma-python.
3. Download all the files.
4. In the EDLightSync.py change the directory to that of your ED journal files (usually C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous).
5. Save the file.
6. In the lifx.py change to your LIFX access token (Use this page to find out how to get your access token: https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/how-to-use-the-following-examples).
7. Save the file.
8. Run the EDLightSync.py once and turn on the Elite Dangerous Sync Chroma app in the Razer Synapse application, then close the program.
9. Run ED.
10. Once ED is in the menu run the EDLightSync.py script again (I know this is not ideal - I am working on it!).
11. Continue with your game and have fun!

Steps 1 to 8 are only required for setup however 9 to 11 are for every use.
