# Elite-Dangerous-LIFX-Chroma-Integration

This program reacts LIFX and Chroma RGB lighting with Elite Dangerous events.

Credit to Vaypron's chroma-python sdk, making this possible in a simple Python script.

This is still in development, bugs are still present and many features are to be added in the future.

Instructions:

1. Download file and change directory of ED journal files and change LIFX access token
2. Run ED
3. Once in the menu start the program (will be changed soon)
